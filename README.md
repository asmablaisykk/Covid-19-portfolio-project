Introduction
The main objective of the analysis is to predict the total death,survival status,total recovery,new cases,cases by continent using various features, and variables. The dataset includes information on 100 + people, which is a subset of the total 200+ people who were affected by covid. The problem statement of the dataset is important because it provides insight into the  survival rates,total deaths during the Covid_19  disaster.
Objective
The main objective of the analysis is to predict the Total death rate,total cases,recovery status, survival status of people on the affected area using various features, including country,WHO region and other variables.

Data Source
The Covid-19 dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information about 100+ countries who were affected by corona virus during its peak time. The dataset is widely used in the data science community as a benchmark dataset for classification modeling and predictive analysis.This dataset for this study was obtained from Kaagle and can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report
